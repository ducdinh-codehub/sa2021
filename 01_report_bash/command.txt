Using awk and build-in variable NR
*Note: we will have the varibles to store the object in one line such as $1,$2,$3,...
For example:
Name         Sport       Class    
NguyenVanA   BongRo      12A3
NguyenVanB   BongDa      10A6
NguyenVanC   CauLong     9A5

$1 = Name; $2 = Sport; $3 = Class
$0 entire line

awk 'NR=5,NR=10 {print $0,NR}' /etc/fstab > extract.txt

#7

sudo chmod a+rwx fullPermissionFile<1....n>.txt
*Note r/w/x: read; write; execute permission

Second do the main task
ls -la | awk '$1=="-rwxrwxrwx" print{$0}'
